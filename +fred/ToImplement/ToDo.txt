- observation_start and observation_end for fred.latest

Aggregation is fucked a bit.
  - Rather than check against Fred, maybe just come up with a sensible way

  - Send them an email with a description of the error so they can fix.
  - Maybe start with aggregating monthly and quarterly data, since that's
    easiest.
  - Then, do daily and weekly
